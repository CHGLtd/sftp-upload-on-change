# sftp-upload-on-change

SFTP upload files on change (Atom Package, early development)

I have created this package because neither remote-sync nor remote-sync-pro works with SFTP - both fail after 9 successful uploads.

Currently watches for files using Chokidar and SFTPs using SSH2 - it's only dependencies.
